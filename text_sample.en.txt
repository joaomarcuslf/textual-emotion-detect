It's been 5 weeks and I still go through depression smh
People too weak to follow their own dreams will always find a way to discourage yours.
Itâ€™s possible changing meds is best not done while under stress. Difficult to tell what part of despair is circumstantial, what is drugs.
@seantkin @coachella @RomanDanielsXXX @kodyknightXXX I see my 'eliminate the hanging tongue' campaign is a dismal failure.
You know when you're just slightly high, the state between sober and high af? That's beautiful. I wish I could feel like that 24/7.

Have any of you ever stayed in hostels overseas? My only frame of reference is the movie Hostel, and we all know how that went.
the thing with Twitter is i only remember to tweet when i'm bored or alone and then it comes across like i have a really dull and sad life.ðŸ‘½

It would appear it's a good year for the #blues

Some questions you get on Twitter make you want to despair. We've been so battered. We complain but aren't convinced things could be better.

@modelady24 I know, right? I had a tinge of the same thought. Glad it's Six from BSG, though. Happy the show stayed consistent after break.

I know I've painted quite a grim picture of your chances. But if you simply stand here, we will both surely die.
I honestly feel nothing towards either of my parents and it's pretty depressing
@AshleyCWilson @MrDavidHobbs @IndyCaronNBCSN Glad the TV coverage was so successful because the attendance looked pretty dismal.
@OzelleM man imagine # Ultra is promoting carnival. I think u need to be the chairperson #serious. Cause am hearing nothing
Feminists should ask themselves, why they're so unhappy, and why they lack love in their lives. Is it b/c they are fighting a losing game?

This whole #VanRE + extradition might turn into a Pandora's box. JT has no idea about that murky corrupt guanxi in China; Toad vs Dada ;-)
@MarkedMurderer Orion's eyes narrowed as he gazed down at the girl, ice cold blues meeting a softer than usual green. His instinct told him-
Well I won't be doing a unboxing of the iPhone 7 plus on my channel until November sadly. Thank you @TMobile @Apple Staten Island NY smh
@RealTimBooth I've never been fond of having dark eyes until seeing this share.

@ExaltedChampion - the jest, Kara didn't chuckle, instead her baby blues were narrowed in on Adam like a warning. If his brain /wasn't/ -

@SalterUK second pair of scales I have bought that have stopped working after battery change. Is this an issue you are aware of?  #unhappy
I saw those dreams dashed &amp;&amp; divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over &amp;&amp; over again ~ sparkling &amp;&amp; broken.
@SussexMistress @sarahb45 @MsEvilyne @MissJessicaWood I'd be perched on that, unfortunately wrapped in heavy chains! #sink...
